Roboflow is an end-to-end computer vision platform that helps you
* collaborate with your team on computer vision projects
* collect & organize images
* understand and search unstructured image data
* annotate, and create datasets
* export, train, and deploy computer vision models
* use active learning to improve your dataset over time

For state of the art Computer Vision training notebooks you can use with this dataset,

The dataset includes 326 images.
Dy96embryos are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 320x320 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:

!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!*! - on export all images were completely blank.
Therefore I generated the dataset again using the exported labels via the 'roboflow_let_me_down.py' file in the github. - Dred
