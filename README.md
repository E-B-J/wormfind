# Microsporidia, Embryos, and Worms identification NETwork - MEWnet

A suite of object detection and segmentation networks to identify C. elegans, C. elegans embryos, and microsporidia/any other probe in fluorescent microscope images.

The tool requires an initial splitting of channels into png files, via the 'czitopng' (or similar custom macro) in the code/functional/ folder.
Images can then be uploaded to a colab runtime and the tool used via the current 'MEWnet' notebook.
